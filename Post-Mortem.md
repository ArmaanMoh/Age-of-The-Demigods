This is my main entry for https://js13kgames.com 
even though I have submitted 2 others(Mainly side projects for fun and not polished).
When Theme got released I immidiately thought of a role-playing game. I could have made it about a soldier or a king 
but at the time I was reading Percy Jackson Books so I got inspired to make a RPG where you play as hercules.

I originally intended the game to have 6 'chapters' but I ran out of space quite early because of all of the sprites.
At the end I decided to stop at just 4 and make a nice ending!

I ended up publishing it without adding animations that work for mobile
as I did not want it to lag but the https://armaanm.itch.io/ageofthedemigods version 
does include animations for mobile and a sound effect for when you jump!

Overall, I was really Happy with the entry and I will continue to submit for the  following years!
